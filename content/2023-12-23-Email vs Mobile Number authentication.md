We were having a discussion on onboarding, and the first roadblock was authentication. So, how do you decide whether to use email or a phone number for authentication?

1. Cost factor - SMS OTP requires DLT registration with a telecom operator, which involves a fee of Rs. 5,900. Also, the cost per email is less than the cost per SMS.
2. DLT registration takes around 7 days for approval. After that, a few more days are needed for SMS template approval.
3. With a mobile number, it’s easy to talk to customers.
4. In India, email is prevalent only among formal sector workers; most just remember their phone number, not their email (personal observation).
5. An email list can be used for Meta ads.

We finally agreed on mobile authentication, as our roadmap involves personal styling services through WhatsApp, and a direct channel to talk with customers is very important. 

P.S. - The above discussion was in the context of an Android app and a very early-stage product.

I've been thinking about how food delivery apps handle ratings, especially for individual food items. There are so many different ways it's done, and I'm trying to understand what works best—both in terms of getting more people to give feedback and in helping users make decisions.

In DoorDash, food items are shown as "% liked/disliked"—like 85% liked (500+)—but restaurants are still rated using the 5-star system. Platforms like Swiggy, Zomato, Gojek stick to the usual 5-star rating for both restaurants and meals, like 4.2 (500+).

What I find interesting is—when we talk about food with friends, it’s always like “I liked it” or “it wasn’t great.” So a like/dislike system feels natural. It’s binary, easy to respond to, and more importantly, it requires less thought. That matters because most users don’t return to the app after getting their food. There's no real incentive to give feedback. And honestly, most times I left feedback were when something went really wrong—not when I was happy.

But at the same time, many people aren’t comfortable giving extreme feedback. They’d rather say something in between—like “it’s fine,” “not bad,” “not amazing either.”
Is that a cultural thing? Like, do users in the US lean more binary while in Asia they sit on the fence more often?

Also, DoorDash gives 5-star ratings for restaurants, but only binary feedback for food items. That contrast made me look at Meituan, which takes a totally different approach.
They still do 5 stars for restaurants, but food items? Super detailed. There are comments with photos, like/dislike, how often a dish was ordered recently, what repeat customers say, even feedback on portion size and taste. It actually builds trust—I get to know what to expect in terms of taste, quantity, and appearance.

DoorDash has some of this too—like user photos—but Meituan really makes it work well in their UI. Maybe that’s because they started out as a review platform before getting into delivery? Or maybe it’s because they reward users for feedback? A lot of Chinese apps do that.

Which makes me think—maybe users in China don’t mind leaving detailed feedback?

Swiggy does something odd here. They ask for like/dislike feedback on food items, but then show it as a 5-star rating. Looks like they’re A/B testing it. They also ask you to “rate meal from X restaurant” with stars, but I couldn’t figure out where that rating even goes.

That got me wondering—do we really need two feedback systems? One for the restaurant, one for the food item? Maybe packaging, hygiene, etc. can go under restaurant, while individual dishes should be judged on taste. That’s just my assumption though—no platform really explains it clearly.

If you look at the user journey, these ratings act like a funnel. First you filter out restaurants, then you go deeper into dishes. But what happens if the restaurant is rated 4+, and their most popular dishes are barely above 3? That disconnect can break trust.

Then there’s the perception part. People often avoid anything under 4 stars. I've seen this happen a lot. Would the same happen with % liked?

Imagine these two cases:
72% liked (5000+) vs 90% liked (10)
3.2 (5000+) vs 4.2 (10)

Which one would you order?

Are users more forgiving of 72% liked (with more data) but much harsher on 3.2 (5000+)? I’ve definitely seen people reject anything below 4 stars, even if it had thousands of reviews.

Anyway, not sure what the right answer is—just something I’ve been thinking about lately.

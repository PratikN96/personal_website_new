I am looking to buy air fryer primarily because Indian cuisine is oil heavy and we want to implement healthier eating habits. Almost all air fryers are offering similar features with variants of different container sizes.

The product description on Amazon, Flipkart didn't answer my queries. I visited store but even they were not totally aware about the product in depth(yep, their fault).

So I just thought - "What information should be mentioned in product description page/known to salesperson to guide users?"
I tried answering it using JBTD forces - 


#### Push

1. I want to eat healthy now that I’ve joined the gym

2. Indian cuisine is very oily, especially non-vegetarian dishes

3. My maid doesn’t know how to cook healthy food, and the canteen doesn’t serve it either

4. I wish there's was a way to eat samosas, fish fry without sacrificing on health

5. Diabetes, cholestrol problems are due to oily food 

#### Pull

1. It’s so easy to cook with an air fryer

2. Big fitness influencers are all recommending it

3. It doesn’t take up much space like a microwave oven

4. I can quickly get groceries or chicken through quick commerce apps

#### Anxiety

1. I’m not really fond of cooking—what if I stop using it after a few days?

2. Are there only a limited number of dishes that can be made with an air fryer?

3. Can a total amateur like me use it effectively?

4. Does it consume a lot of electricity?

5. Is it safe? Someone told me it causes cancer.

6. How much time does it take to cook? I have to leave for the office early in the morning.

7. Will the taste be as good as regular cooking?

#### Habit

1. I still need to do some cooking preparations.

2. The food doesn’t taste the same.

3. I can just order something healthy instead.

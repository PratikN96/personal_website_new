I opened CRED after a year and there are so many services now. UPI scanner is at the bottom nav, it doesn’t generate revenue so why? It is the same with their bank statement analyser tool. Why did they launch such a no-revenue product? 

So we can just divide the transactions like this - 
Total payment value = Users * avg payment value per user

= Users * total products *  avg payment value per product per user

= Users * (monetised products + Non-monetised products) *  avg payment value per product per user

Kunal Shah used the term “ monetised users” in his recent press release, so we can divide users further 
                               
= (monetised users + non-monetised users)* (monetised products + Non-monetised products) *  avg payment  value per product per user

So we have four groups now -
Monetised users * monetised products

Monetised users * non-monetised products

Non-monetised users* non-monetised products

Non-monetised users* monetised products? Maybe those interacting with coins, rewards (I didn’t consider these as monetised products)

Let’s take UPI for example, the only thing it can do is increase active users. Maybe provide credit on UPI? 
Active users mean building habits and keeping the product on top of mind. But as a fintech platform, do Cred even need to focus on this?
Is it the same for other non-monetised products?

Two-thirds of users are non-monetised - they are using only these three products every month. CRED just want to keep these users engaged in the hope of monetising them in future. 

There’s no switching cost effect for users in this market. Will engagement help in some way? 
Given this uncertainty, CRED will keep launching new products. CRED can launch fast as it doesn’t go through the licence route, instead acts as an agent/ middleman. 

So let’s say I pay my health insurance premium through the insurer’s official app, I can now pay it with CRED. So maybe a series of insurance products will come up like health, life. There can be even a co-branded credit card. A home loan? It has data to consider these products as suitable for its high creditworthy users.

I wonder what is Cred’s “monthly transacting monetised products per user”. Can CRED increase it without inflating CAC? Swiggy, Tata Neu and others failed at it(so far).

            <p>We were having a discussion on onboarding, and the first roadblock was authentication. So, how do you decide whether to use email or a phone number for authentication?</p>
<ol>
<li>Cost factor - SMS OTP requires DLT registration with a telecom operator, which involves a fee of Rs. 5,900. Also, the cost per email is less than the cost per SMS.</li>
<li>DLT registration takes around 7 days for approval. After that, a few more days are needed for SMS template approval.</li>
<li>With a mobile number, it’s easy to talk to customers.</li>
<li>In India, email is prevalent only among formal sector workers; most just remember their phone number, not their email (personal observation).</li>
<li>An email list can be used for Meta ads.</li>
</ol>
<p>We finally agreed on mobile authentication, as our roadmap involves personal styling services through WhatsApp, and a direct channel to talk with customers is very important. </p>
<p>P.S. - The above discussion was in the context of an Android app and a very early-stage product.</p>

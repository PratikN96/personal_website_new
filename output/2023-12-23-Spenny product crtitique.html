            <p>So, this is my first shot at product critique. I want to do this more and hope to improve with time.</p>
<p>I heard about Spenny on Twitter, it was drawing a lot of attention from people I follow ( apparently I have very few followers). I just knew that it is a fintech product and has something to do with saving money. Let’s dig in -</p>

<p>I don’t have an idea about their GTM strategy but a college community-driven approach like Tinder, or Facebook can yield growth.</p>
<p>Additionally, I think that if the same product can drive more growth and value if added to already existing payment applications like Paytm, and PhonePe. And thus, is Spenny a product or feature?</p>

<p>There’s only one situation where Spenny comes into the picture and I would regard it as a feature as of now 
Disclaimer: The product may have additional situational moments, and features in future and my assessment is only about the current state of the product.</p>
<p>Let’s see what more surprises Spenny will bring along its journey. </p>

            <h1>What's up with Netflix Advertisement?</h1>

            <p>Netflix lost 1 mn subscribers last quarter, still lower than the expected 2 mn subscribers.</p>
<p>For starters, Netflix earns a whopping $30 bn from its subscription business with 200 mn+ subscribers. But this is the first time in the last decade that Netflix lost subscribers in two consecutive quarters.</p>
<p>So what’s next?</p>
<p>Netflix announced that it will bring in ads to keep up the game.</p>
<p>But first, what exactly is Netflix trying to do on the revenue side?</p>
<p>Current Netflix revenue stream = Subscription Price * Number of users</p>
<p>To increase revenue, either increase the number of users or raise the price. But raising the price will result in user churn and there’s a limit to how much Netflix can raise the price without hurting the revenue due to user churn.</p>
<p>So, increasing users is the only option. And where’s the opportunity?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Users binging on another member’s credentials</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Potential users left out because of the high price</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, clearly lowering prices will increase the accessible market. And here’s where they bring in the advertisement business</p>
<p>Revenue = No. of Ad impressions &amp; Clicks + Subscription Price * Number of users</p>
<p>So, basically, there’s a new revenue stream and thus the price can be lowered to draw in more users.</p>
<p>Interestingly the ad revenue aligns with Netflix’s NSM of watch time. More watch time will increase ad impressions and clicks</p>
<p>But then what’s the edge over traditional TV commercials?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Quantifiable — The ad partners will be able to measure the ROI of running ads on Netflix just like on YouTube</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Targeting user group — Netflix already have data on the psychological profile of users which allows for effectively targeting ads</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what’s the edge over YouTube or other internet-based ad channels?</p>
<p>It all depends primarily on how much time users spend on these platforms/ apps, the natural purpose of the platform plus a lot of other things.</p>
<p><img src="https://pratikn96.github.io/personal_website/assets/images/whats_up_with_netflix_advertisement.jpg" width="100%" height="auto"></p>
<p>Clearly, Netflix wins here. And given the purpose of users being leisurely, and relaxing while binging Netflix, ads are more receptive.</p>
<p>But there are a lot of other factors to consider –</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What will be the cost of advertising on Netflix?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What degree of flexibility Netflix will offer to ad partners in terms of targeting users?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How frequently ads will be shown? how many mins of ads per hour?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In any case, it will be interesting to see how Netflix’s new advertisement model will create a positive impact on revenue.</p>

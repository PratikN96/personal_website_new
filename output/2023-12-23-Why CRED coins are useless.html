            <h1>"Why CRED coins are useless?"</h1>

            <p>I recently came across a post on X about shifting to Cheq and leaving Cred because there are rewards. Other comments also mentioned the same citing useless Cred Coins.</p>
<p>After analysing CRED Coins i.e the gamified ecosystem, it all made sense - </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Activities not aligned with the goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very easy to earn coins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coins don’t hold much value as output</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No devaluation of coins</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Activities not aligned with the goals</h4>
<p>So far, given the marketing spend and Kunal Shah’s own views, the focus has been on user acquisition.</p>
<p>But none of the gamification activities in any sense aligns with this goal. The current version is just a simple two-step process -   play game -&gt; get coupon/coins</p>
<p>The reward i.e coupons are applicable on 3rd party apps/websites and thus too much friction to realise its value.</p>
<p>The whole reward section of the app is just a beautiful decluttered version of coupondunia.</p>
<h4>Very easy to earn coins</h4>
<p>There’s no aspect of any challenge in earning coins. Every activity either lands on coupons or coins.</p>
<p>There’s no scarcity of coins at any point in the user timeline.</p>
<p>It would have been better if earning coins were limited to functions of playing credit card bill, electricity, payment, etc which are core use cases.</p>
<h4>Coins don’t hold much value as output</h4>
<p>What can I do with CRED coins? Get random coupons.</p>
<p>Just looking at some popular benefits rewarded by credit card users can give us a slight idea of what users value the most -
Direct cashback</p>
<p>Utility payment discount</p>
<p>Flipkart, Swiggy, uber, dinning etc discount</p>
<p>Travel benefits, hotel memberships</p>
<p>On top of that coins hold no value of its own - use 2000 coins to get 30%, 40% or 70% discount.</p>

<h4>No devaluation of coins</h4>
<p>I opened CRED after 6-7 months to analyse the coin system and to my surprise, coins were still the same(around 80k) when I last used them.
Coins are not related to time at all, I haven’t been reprimanded for my inactivity. So, I will never have any fear of losing those coins and investing time in the app to save/hold them.</p>
<p>The whole gamification is like having a treasure chest on a remote deserted island.</p>
<p>I tried to redesign the gamification journey roughly - </p>

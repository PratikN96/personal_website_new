            <h1>When segmentation fails to explain behavior</h1>

            <p>Customer segmentation is important concept in marketing, startups, business. You should know your target customer, don't waste marketing money on customers outside your target group. I always found it very different from reality. But because I learnt it in my MBA class, I just convince myself with " it doesn't follow for few people only". Over the time, such people I can count have increased a lot.</p>
<p>My uncle owns a car, 3 storey house built on his own money, combine income of around 18 LPA in tier 2 city like Nagpur. So his wife spend like Rs.3000-4000 in beauty parlour for every wedding or other events but her clothes are max Rs.1000, sometimes rent it or buy from wholesale market.
She doesn't trust online shopping, I bet she even tried it but yes, orders from Swiggy sometimes. Shopping mall? never, that's expensive.</p>
<p>My mom's friend, her husband bought car of 14 lakh, and she buys clothes from Meesho. Leave quick commerce, she doesn't buy vegetable if the prices are Rs.10 higher than usual. Oh yes, but she buys artificial jewellery of more than Rs.500 often.</p>
<p>My brothers's friends work as entry level developer at IT company in India, everyone got iPhone and car but they buy only discounted item in Zudio. </p>
<p>A girl who works as sales representative in car showroom. She own car and iPhone, buy daily wear clothes from Dmart and once a year flies to Surat for shopping other apparels and items. No online shopping maybe meesho.</p>
<p>Now you can't divide them by income, city, working , non-working and other typical segments.
A person who owns car of 16 Lakhs might be buying from Zudio and someone who owns Realme might be buying from H&amp;M.
People think segmentation is straightforward. You make a chart, plug in some data, and boom—you know your customer.</p>
<p>The reasons behind this can be multiple.
The status parameters are defined by the person's surroundings. For a guy from Borgaon(small village in MH), Birkenstock and Sparx are the same while it's something to show off for a senior manager in Bengluru.</p>
<p>It also depends on the importance that product holds for the user. I know women who are doing job of 5k per month while they have maid of 3k at home. So, if you think such maid service can only be for high income family then you might be wrong.</p>
<p>So the ideal customer is one who knows the value of your product and that's something can't be defined by generic terms like tier-2 cities, x-y age groups, price range, etc. </p>
<p>People think segmentation is straightforward. You make a chart, plug in some data, and boom—you know your customer.
It does make sense like in case of Birkenstock to target those in selected cities because they understand its value there, a clear overlap. It can't be said about iPhone even though it is 5x expensive than Birkenstock. </p>
<p>Just because something is expensive doesn't means the demand exist in metro cities. The same can be said about other typical segments. </p>

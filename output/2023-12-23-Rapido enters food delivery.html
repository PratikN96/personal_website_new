            <h1>Rapido enters food delivery</h1>
            <p class="post-date">Published on: 2025-05-06</p>

            <p>Rapido announced entry into the food delivery market whose growth is on decline as per Zomato's latest quarter report. But as seen from Zepto Cafe, Blinkit Bistro - there's still available demand not catered by Zomato, Swiggy. What are the options left for Rapido in this case? </p>
<h4>Partnering with big restaurant chains</h4>
<p>Rapido will get immediate order volume from restaurants' own existing customers. It ensures enough restaurants are available for users to choose from. As there's a rider shortage in the market, these restaurants must be more than willing to secure their timely deliveries. Rapido avoids issues like long waiting times, packaging, and quality because big chains are more efficient than small restaurants. For such restaurants, a tiered subscription can be offered as they have high volume and thus it is beneficial for them. Rapido can manage customer support easily because these restaurants are efficient.</p>
<h4>Low AOV users</h4>
<p>Rapido's current users are majorly value-conscious who prefer auto, bike over cabs.
None of the items in Swiggy, Zomato are below 250 rs per person. Gojek has launched Hemat Mode to target these users. I was surprised to see KFC, McDonalds in this value-conscious mode. They were offering 4-5 small-value curated items from restaurants within 3-4 kms. Rapido can pull off something similar but people are getting accustomed to quicker deliveries. Will users be okay with slower deliveries and less fresh food if the price is low? Well, they can add an option of fast delivery with more charges. And if they can't increase the AOV, then order frequency should be more. And that's the most difficult part.
Rapido bike is mostly used for last-mile connectivity, like when I want to reach office/home from a metro station. Unlike Uber cabs, which are mostly near airports or railway stations, Rapido bikes cover short distances in areas where their users live. It will give them an advantage to batch or group orders. Rapido needs to do it for lowering delivery costs. Rapido could offer full meals from local restaurants, unlike Blinkit’s focus on snacks and frozen items, appealing to users seeking variety.</p>
<p>Also, Rapido must be looking to channel its taxi users to the food delivery vertical, will it be a new app? Or will they go through the super app way? A separate app with a navigation bar like Zomato’s is a reliable approach. In the end, if they can control the CAC, they can pass on the benefits to users unlocking low prices.</p>
<p>Why can't Swiggy, Zomato do the same? The same reason why Uber didn't, they can't hurt margins being public traded companies.
Over time, managing riders will be important. There will be a supply constraint at some point in time because these businesses have local network effects. Ultimately, users will choose the service that delivers food fastest if prices are the same.
It's just my assessment, Rapido may go all in with onboarding restaurants and target cities beyond tier-1. Or it may focus on small restaurants with a subscription model.  Many factors affect food delivery, which has thin margins, even the Chinese giant Meituan rely on ads businesses. But ads not gonna come until they bring in lot of users. Still many things to solve like how will they reduce CAC? value conscious users will jump to another platform if they offer incentives, how to keep users hooked in? How to limit the support costs? How to build incentives for riders that include both taxi + food delivery? It will be interesting to see how Rapido plays. </p>
